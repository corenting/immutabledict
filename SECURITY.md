# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

immutabledict will receive security updates for the current major version and the two previous ones, for the latest minor version of each.

immutabledict will receive security updates for each of 1 minor versions within 3 major versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue, please do **not** report it through GitHub issues.

Instead, report it directly via email at corenting@gmail.com to coordinate disclosure and the release of fixed versions. Since immutabledict uses [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/), they will also be notified.
